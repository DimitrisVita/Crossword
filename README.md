# Crossword solver
That project was developed during "Introduction to Programming" course of the "Department of Informatic and Telecommunications" - UoA. We were asked to create a program that solves crosswords in the minimum possible time.

## Creators:

 [Evangelos Argyropoulos](https://github.com/vaggelisarg13)

 [Dimitrios Vitantzakis](https://github.com/DimitrisVita)

## Compilation:  

### How to run
```bash
 ~ make run
```
### How to change crossword 
```bash
 ~ ./crossw Crossword(X).txt
```
### Done? 
```bash
 ~ make clean
```
## Notes: 

1. The '-dict' question of the exersicise may not be perfect, it can solve for sure 'Crossword1.txt' and 'Crossword2.txt'.

2. There is a doubt if it can solve the other crosswords of the pronunciation. To tell the truth, it takes time and we have not waited that much to find out.

3. Quicksort_body function is based on the notes of the ["INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING"](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ip/K04.pdf) subject.
